    Bury me, my Love tells the story of Syrian refugee Nour and her husband Majd,
    as Nour undertakes a perilous journey to safety in Europe.

    Bury me, my Love is a Text Messaging Adventure game about Nour,
    a Syrian migrant trying to find her way to Europe. Her husband Majd, who
    remains behind in Syria, communicates with Nour through a messaging app,
    advising her as best he can so that she reaches her destination safely.

    Bury me, my love is a Syrian goodbye phrase that roughly means, Take care,
    don’t even think about dying before I do. This phrase takes on a deeper
    meaning as Majd says it to his wife, Nour, as she undertakes her perilous
    journey to reach Europe.

    A co-production from ARTE, the European cultural network, with The Pixel Hunt and Figs.

    A game in an instant messaging app
    As Majd, you can communicate with Nour and follow her journey, just as if you
    were chatting with her via text message. You will text each other and exchange
    emojis, pics and selfies, relevant links...

    Multiple narrative routes to discover
    By reading instant messages and choosing response options, players help Nour overcome
    the hardships she will encounter.

    Your choices in Bury me, my Love truly impact on the story, with Nour able to visit
    50 different locations and reach 19 potential different endings with widely divergent outcomes.

    Based on real-life events
    Bury me, my Love is a reality-inspired game. This experience may affect the sensitivity
    of younger people.
